# Data Governance Portfolio – Nathan Weber

This site presents a focused set of data governance artifacts illustrating how early integration of CISO and security stakeholders can improve data onboarding, analytics readiness, and governance maturity for a modern utility data office.

## Portfolio Contents

- [Governance Framework with Security Integration](B_Framework_Cybersec.md)
- [Data Onboarding & Governance SOP (with Security)](C_SOP_Cybersec.md)
- [Data Contract & Security Addendum Template](D_Contract_Cybersec.md)
- [Austin Energy Data Governance Case Study](Case_Study_Austin_Energy.md)
- [Cybersecurity Integration Guide for Data Governance](Cybersec_Integration_Guide.md)
- [Data Governance Quick Reference Card](Quick_Reference_Card.md)

Each artifact is structured to support a maturing Data Management & Governance function and to align governance, security, and modern data platform usage (e.g., Snowflake, Azure Synapse, Databricks) in a practical, implementation-ready way.
