# Data Governance Portfolio — Nathan Weber

This site provides a focused sample of my data governance and data management work, including:

- Governance framework and operating model  
- Standard operating procedure (SOP) for secure data onboarding  
- Data contract and security addendum template  
- Austin Energy–focused case study  
- Cybersecurity integration guide  
- Quick reference stakeholder card  

These artifacts illustrate my approach to improving governance maturity, aligning data onboarding with modern data platforms (Snowflake, Synapse, Databricks), and integrating security early in the lifecycle to reduce downstream rework.
